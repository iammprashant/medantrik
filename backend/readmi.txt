More Works on the Project: google sign in , email otp sign in up, .env file creation

COMMON: npm install command used to install existing project

step-1: create backend folder and a readmi file
step-2: to create react app, run in powershell npx create-react-app medantrik
step-3: cd backend, to create backend , run npm init
step-4: intall packages
            1. mongoose -: an abstraction layer to connect backend to mongodb , run npm i mongoose@6.10.1
            2. create index.js entry point of our application
step-5: remove / frome gitignore file as you donot need to push
step-6: For npm install specific version, use npm install [package-name]@[version-number]
            npm install express@4.18.2- Express.js, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
step-7: make db.js so that seperate file that deals with database
        and create database medantrik in mongocompass , and collections notes and users
step-8: install nodemon - npm i -D nodemon - here D for use only in developing time
        nodemon .\index.js\ -> to run nodejs server
step-9: create models folder : Models are used by moongoose, telling that how data and type of data stored in mongodb
        database ke ander collections ke ander documents ie json just like how table structure are there in database
        inside this folder create file with capitalise name
step-9: create routes folder
        routes are used to create api link
        create two files auth.js and notes.js
        auth.js deals with sign in, sign up purpose
        notes.js deals to preview the notes of particular users
        NOTE: app.use(express.json());// to use req.body, it is a middleware. in index.js file
step-10: install express- validator pkg which helps in validation of sign up and sign in data 
        npm install --save express-validator@6.12.1
        check points is in square bracket [], which is a array
        Using this user.save() is used as User.create , Basically save() function is used save data in database
        *To block duplicate entry of unique email we can use indexing but we use findone() function
step-11: To save data in mongdb we use: 
        const user = User(req.body);
        user.save(); XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
step-12: create thunderclient collection medantrik and then authentication, Notes-CRUD  : Export the data and push to github
         
         QUES: What is logger and SQS in case of try and catch
step-13: install bcryptjs it deals with password security in database by hashing,salting,peppering
        npm install bcryptjs@2.4.3

        NOTE: Mark callback function as async whenever you use await bcoz it returns a promise which should be resolve
step-14: whenever a user login into their accounts we give tokens: two types session and json web token
         here we use jwt token: A way to verify a user without entering password (algorithm, data ie userid, signature)
         JWT_SECRET is use by server to sign the token for particular user 
         it fasciliates client-server communication
         npm install jsonwebtoken@9.0.0

         NOTE: select("-password") means select all element except password
step-15: To remove the problems of id lene ka code write at every end points we us middleware
         *To make application scalable, means once sign in and use all the services of application
         * Nodejs Middleware is a function which is called wherever any request goes to login required(or to get logged in 
         user detail) routes
step-16: Make a folder middleware , create a file fetchuser.js
        next() tells that next (req,res) will be run
        JWT_SECRET should not mis-match anywhere
step-17: params.id is a specific note id not user id;
